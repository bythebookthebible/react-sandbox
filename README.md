# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
And modified with a more descriptive demo app.

## Dependencies

In order to use this, you will need to have 
[git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) 
and [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 
installed. In order to check if you have these installed, you can run 
`git --version`, `node --version`, and `npm --version`
in the command line. npm should be included when you install node.

## Clone

You can clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/bythebookthebible/react-sandbox.git`

Next you will need to run `npm install` to get the other dependencies.

## Run

Run `npm start` to run the app locally in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Edit

All of the files you want to edit for your app should go in the `src` directory. The other directories are there to support React.

There is currently a demo in `src/App.js` and `src/App.css`, which you can replace with whatever app or game you want to build.
